# Whiskey Review Analysis
The purpose of this project is to scrape whiskey reviews from different sources and analyze them to determine similarities between different whiskeys. The intent is to identify similarities between different distilleries, brands, and bottles in a semi-supervised manner. Initially whiskeys will be grouped in an unsupervised fashion, then additional data labeling will be completed based on anecdotal experience or fusion of multiple datasets.
